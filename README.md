PyCity Schools Analysis

The below report summarizes student performance data of math and reading scores accross 15 high schools. The data is segmented for easy understanding and comprehension into 9 dataqframes as follows: District Summary, School Summary, Highest-Performing School by Percentage of Overall Passing, Lowest-Perfrorming School by Percentage of OVerall Passing,Math Scores by Grade, Reading Scores by Grade, Scores by School Spending, Scores by School Size, and Scores by School Type. Noteable factors of student performance propvided in the report include school budget, number of attending students, and the type of school.

Through analysis of the provided data it appears that students generally perform better in a school of a small to medium population. There was a neglegible difference in student overall performance if the school had a maximum of 2000 students. The academic perforcance, in terms of overall passing rate, of students that attended larger schools consisting of 2000 to 5000 students was roughly 30% worse than that of students attending smaller schools. 

The schools budget seems to not be a factor in the perfornce of its students as some schools with a lower budget per student outperformed other schools that had a higher budget per student.

Charter schools also outperformed District schools in the overally passing rate with Charter schools scoring roughly 37% higher.
